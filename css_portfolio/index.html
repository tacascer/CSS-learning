        <h2>Electrical and Computer Engineer</h2>

        <p>
          Current Engineering student with 3 years of experience in Computer
          Engineering and Computer Science. My interests lie in Embedded
          Systems, Operating Systems, Microcontrollers, and Artificial

        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my accomplishments and life choices stem from my passion to
          improve other's lives. From pursuing a career in Engineering to
          assisting others at the school library, I am always looking to improve
          the lives of people around me. I am hopeful to see where my passion
          for making positive impacts in my community will take me.

          <h3>Tempus</h3>
          <img src="images/tempus.png" alt="Tempus" />
          <p>
            Tempus is a fast-paced action game that launches players into the
            heat of battle in a beautiful, strange fantasy world. Players
            inhabit Fluz, a powerful avian Timewalker, who can shift at will
            between the past and the present. This allows players to evade
            dangers in one time or leverage weapons from the other, as they dash
            between two worlds to survive and ultimately rewrite the timeline.
